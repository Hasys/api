<p>Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) defines the following 
complementary services:</p>

<ul>
<li>The lifecycle and interactions of stateful 
{@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject beans} bound to well-defined 
lifecycle {@linkplain javax.enterprise.context contexts}, where 
the set of contexts is {@linkplain javax.enterprise.context.spi 
extensible}</li>
<li>A sophisticated, typesafe {@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject 
dependency injection mechanism}, including a 
{@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject.Alternative facility} for 
choosing between various beans that implement the same Java 
interface at deployment time</li>
<li>{@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject Integration} with the 
Unified Expression Language, allowing any bean to be used directly 
within a JSF or JSP page</li>
<li>The ability to {@linkplain javax.decorator decorate} injected 
components</li>
<li>The ability to associate 
{@linkplain javax.interceptor interceptors} with beans via 
{@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject typesafe interceptor bindings}</li>
<li>An {@linkplain javax.enterprise.event event} notification model</li>
<li>A web {@linkplain javax.enterprise.context.ConversationScoped 
conversation context} in addition to the three standard 
web contexts defined by the Java Servlets specification</li>
<li>An {@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject.spi SPI} allowing portable 
extensions to integrate cleanly with the Java EE environment</li>
</ul>

<p>CDI allows objects to be bound to lifecycle contexts, to be 
injected, to be associated with interceptors and decorators, and to 
interact in a loosely coupled fashion by 
{@linkplain javax.enterprise.event.Event firing} and 
{@linkplain javax.enterprise.event.Observes observing} events. 
{@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject Various kinds} of objects are 
injectable, including EJB 3 session beans, managed beans, 
{@linkplain javax.enterprise.inject.Produces producer methods } and 
Java EE resources. We refer to these objects in general terms as beans 
and to instances of beans that are bound to contexts as contextual 
instances.</p>
